## Communications

Please reach out to us using GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions).

We are also available on the [CNCF Slack Workspace](https://slack.cncf.io/). Avoid sending direct messages to organization admins and project maintainers unless strictly necessary as doing so has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and prevents others with similar questions from benefitting from your public discussion.

While its best to relay your inquiries in a public forum, should you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the admins a note at mentoring@cncf.io. Be sure to use public channels for any project-related discussion.
